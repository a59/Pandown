        PANDOWN FOR SUBLIME TEXT 2 & 3
              by Daniel Shannon
    ======================================
        Please note that in this version
        of Pandown, the syntax for the
        configuration files has changed.
        To see what the new format should
        look like, check the settings
        files or take a look at:
{Packages}/Pandown/default-pandoc-config.json
        
        The crux of the change is that the
        settings have been split into two
        dictionaries, one for Markdown
        extensions and one for command-line
        arguments, and the command-line
        arguments are named with dashes
        rather than underscores. This change
        roughly halves the amount of code
        in Pandown, and speeds it up
                considerably.

        Please feel free to write Daniel
