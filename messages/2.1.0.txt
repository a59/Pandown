        PANDOWN FOR SUBLIME TEXT 2 & 3
              by Daniel Shannon
    ======================================
        Patient Window users will be
        thrilled to hear that this version
        of Pandown has been tested on and
        fixed-up for Windows 7. The last
        of the bugs causing crashes,
        freezes, and quiet failures seem
        to have been righteously
        squashed. But if you have any
        additional trouble, please don't
        hesitate to open a Github issue
        or e-mail d at daniel dot sh.
