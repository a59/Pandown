        Pandown Plugin for Sublime Text 2
------------------------------------------------
                Version 1.3.0

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
    * Now designed to work with Pandoc version
      1.10 or higher. Versions lower than 1.10
      will no longer be supported or tested.
      Please upgrade to continue using Pandown.

MINOR FIXES
	* UTF-8 characters that were bewildering
	  Pandoc have been removed from the sample
	  files and README.

KNOWN ISSUES
	* Pandoc seems to be having trouble with
	  code blocks fenced with backticks. You
	  may need to switch to tildes until this
	  is corrected.
