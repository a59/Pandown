        Pandown Plugin for Sublime Text 2
------------------------------------------------
                Version 1.1.0

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
    * A preconfigured template is now
      included, thanks to Brett Terpstra.
      See the "Samples" directory for
      information. Send Brett a thank-you
      if you like it (http://brettterpstra.com),
      and look into his Marked app for
      even more beautiful Markdown themes
      (http://markedapp.com).

BUG FIXES
    * DRAMATICALLY improved and cleaned up code
      that checks for files to include. It now
      checks the project folder hierarchy for
      _any_ file passed to Pandoc, not just
      pandoc-config.json.
    * Several predefined arguments were
      not looking in the `includes_paths`
      for their files. They now will, in
      addition to checking the folder hierarchy.
    * If a buffer without a filename was open,
      the function to open the built file would
      fail ungracefully. It now behaves
      better.
    * Error messages from Pandoc were sometimes
      not being parsed by Sublime. They'll
      now be picked up as they should.

MINOR FIXES
    * A typo implied that anyone would create
      a link called "do here!" ever. It's been
      fixed.
